  Aim: provide a reference and a list of starting points for learning programming

  Level: beginner ðŸŒ±

To get started with programming, especially if going into bioinformatics, Python might be a good
programming language of choice. If the analysis you plan to perform are going to be more statistical
in nature, R might be a good alternative.

Programming courses at UiO

Machine learning and causal inference
=========================================

Introduction to machine learning (from a computational biology perspective)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. note::

  Aims:

  - get intuition and high-level understanding of what machine learning is and what types of problems it can help solving;
  - this material will also show that machine learning is not just a black box, but that different choices have important implications;
  - provide the overall understanding that there are a data representation component and a machine learning algorithm;
  - achieve high-level understanding of machine learning workflow, comparison and the related uncertainty

  Level: beginner ðŸŒ±

If you are new to machine learning and want to apply it in a biological discipline, the following material might provide a convenient introduction.
It consists of 6 parts and combines the content and references with tasks and quizzes to test the covered material.

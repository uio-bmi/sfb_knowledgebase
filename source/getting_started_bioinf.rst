Getting started in bioinformatics
==================================

.. note::

  Aim: Provide a reference list of resources to get started in the computational aspects of bioinformatics.

Running an analysis from the command line in UNIX environment
----------------------------------------------------------------

Run tools from a Docker image
------------------------------------

Docker image is a template, a definition of how a computing environment (including libraries, packages, installations and the operating system) should
look like. Based on a Docker image, a Docker container is created which is the environment itself based on the image.

To run a tool from Docker environment, see the following tutorials: :ref:`Install Docker` and :ref:`Run a Docker container locally`.

Running tools developed at the Centre for Bioinformatics

immuneML
~~~~~~~~~~

immuneML, a platform for machine learning analysis of adaptive immune receptors and repertoires, can be ran from the command line, Docker container,
or through an online graphical interface. To get started, graphical user interface might be the most convenient:

- the graphical interface can be accessed at https://galaxy.immuneml.uio.no
- documentation is available at `this link <https://docs.immuneml.uio.no/latest/galaxy.html>`_.

For alternative ways to run immuneML and detailed user documentation, visit `the immuneML documentation website <https://docs.immuneml.uio.no>`_.

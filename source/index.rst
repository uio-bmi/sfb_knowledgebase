Centre for Bioinformatics - Knowledge Base
===========================================

.. note::

   This website is under development.

For a bioinformatician, a broad variety of topics may be of interest to design and conduct an analysis.
This repository is a collection of resources for these tasks grouped by a common theme. The resources include both custom content
and links to relevant online material and training.

To describe the complexity level of each topic, there will be one of the following signs next to the title to indicate:
ðŸŒ± (beginner level, no previous knowledge needed), ðŸŒ¿ (apprentice level, some previous experience on the topic might be useful to
follow the content) and ðŸŒ³ (journeyman level, assuming experience on the given topic and the content might be quite detailed).

Quick start for new members ðŸŒ±
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Follow one of these tutorials to set up a demo project. The steps for these projects will ensure that you have access to BMI resources
and some basic understanding of setting up a project. Even if you have a lot of experience, it might still be useful to go through the
tutorials even if only to set up necessary accounts.

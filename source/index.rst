Centre for Bioinformatics - Knowledge Base
===========================================

.. note::

   This website is under development.

For a bioinformatician, a broad variety of topics may be of interest to design and conduct an analysis.
This repository is a collection of resources for these tasks grouped by a common theme. The resources include both custom content
and links to relevant online material and training.

Quick start for new members
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Follow one of these tutorials to set up a demo project. The steps for these projects will ensure that you have access to BMI resources
and some basic understanding of setting up a project.

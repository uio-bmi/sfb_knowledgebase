Setting up and organizing a project
===================================

.. note:: ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ³

  Aim: provide reference for a set of topics as well as further reading material for interested readers

  Level: any ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ³

  More advanced sections are labeled with ðŸŒ¿ (apprentice) and ðŸŒ³ (journeyman).

This section covers topics in:

- project coordination / management tools,
- version control using git,
- virtual environments and package management with e.g., pip and conda,
- code editors.

Project management tools
--------------------------

For both personal and team projects, projects management tools are extremely useful. The tool most commonly
used at the Centre for Bioinformatics is `Trello <https://trello.com/home>`_. Trello is a free online tool
where it is possible to create project boards with lists and concrete to do items.

There are many alternatives, but only some will be mentioned here:

- `GitHub projects and task lists <https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-task-lists>`_
  might be useful for large codebase projects.

Version control with git
-------------------------

Version control systems are used to track changes during the code development. They are useful both for
individuals and teams, and as such should be used in every software project. Git is the most used such system,
and is provided by GitHub and other providers (such as GitLab or Bitbucket).

The Biomedical Informatics research group at the University of Oslo has a GitHub organisation where the
repositories can be created for each project of the group members. For public projects, see
`BMI organization on GitHub <https://github.com/uio-bmi>`_.

To learn about git, see `the CodeRefinery project <https://coderefinery.org/>`_ resources:

- `Introduction to version control with Git <https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/>`_
- `Collaborative distributed version control <https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/>`_
- `Git branch design lesson <https://coderefinery.github.io/git-branch-design/>`_

Alternatively, a lot of public resources for version control are available, such as these Atlassian tutorials
for `learning version control <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control>`_ and
`learning about git <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-git>`_.

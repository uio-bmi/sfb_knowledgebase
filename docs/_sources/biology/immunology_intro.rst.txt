Getting started with immunology and adaptive immune receptors
=======================================================================================

.. note::

  Aim: provide basic introduction and references in the field of adaptive immune receptors and repertoires

  Level: beginner ðŸŒ±


The immune system protects the organism against pathogens, such as viruses or bacteria, but also the organism's
own malicious cells, in cases such as cancer. The immune system relies on two mechanisms for this purpose: (i) innate
immunity in charge of the immediate response and (ii) adaptive immunity, mounting a slower but a more specific response.

The adaptive immune system includes B- and T-cells and their receptors that recognize the pathogens. These immune receptors
consist of two paired sequences (two chains) of amino acids which are highly diverse, and highly specific towards certain pathogens.
In the case of B-cell receptors (BCRs, also called antibodies when secreted), there are two symmetric heavy and light chains in the
receptor, while the T-cell receptor (TCR) consists of an alpha (Î±) and a beta (Î²) chain. The chains in both B- and T-cell
receptors include a hypervariable region called complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3, a sequence between 5 and 20 amino acids long),
which is believed to be the most significant for recognition of the pathogen. The set of all immune receptors in an individual
is called the immune repertoire, that keeps receptors specific to previously encountered pathogens so that it can quickly respond
upon reinfection. In this manner, the immune repertoire records all past and present treats, thus allowing for diagnostics development
based on the repertoire analysis.

## Chapter 5.1: Machine Learning Basics

As has been described previously in the Knowledge Base, Machine Learning can be defined in many ways. One principle starting point is with the definition of "learning", with this an objective baseline can be established and progression in decision-making can be effectively measured. In the following we explore and build on the concept of learning provided by Tom Mitchell in 1997 and present a real-world example which incorporates this definition

### Definition of "Learning" and a Practical Example

-- Mitchell 1997

  "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

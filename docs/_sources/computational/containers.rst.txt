Containers
--------------

With many different operating systems and local setups, it is often a challenging task to get all the
required software up and running. Containers are one possible solution that. They encapsulate the entire
working environment including not only needed applications and packages, but also an operating system.
Their main goal is to handle all dependencies in a standardized and reliable manner and ensure that the
same applications can be run on the new computing environment (laptop, server, HPC, etc. depending on the application).

Docker
~~~~~~~

Docker is one container platform we have used in projects at the Centre.

Docker defines several types of objects, but here we will mention only images and containers. Docker
containers are the same as containers discussed above: the full computing environments taking care of all
dependencies. Docker images, on the other hand, are templates defining how these environments are created.

.. seealso::

  For more information on Docker objects, see the official `Docker object documentation <https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/#docker-objects>`_.

This section will cover and link to resources for using the existing Docker images and creating new ones.

Install Docker
````````````````

To install Docker, follow `the official Docker installation guide <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>`_.

Run a Docker container locally
````````````````````````````````

.. note:: ðŸŒ¿

  Aim: create and run a Docker container from a publicly available Docker image

  Level: apprentice ðŸŒ¿

Once Docker is installed and running locally, check the list of available containers by running the
following command from the terminal:

.. code-block:: console

  docker ps -a

If you just installed Docker, this list will be empty. If there are any containers, the list will show
container ID, image from which it was created, when it was created, current status, etc.


Copy the following command in the terminal to pull a public Docker image, create a container from it
and run a sample analysis. As an example, we here use `immuneML <https://immuneml.uio.no>`_ image. immuneML
is a software for machine learning analysis of immune receptors. In this example run, it will generate a synthetic dataset
and try to fit a classifier to predict if a person is sick or healthy for the simulated disease.

This command will:

- make the current working directory (pwd) visible inside the container at path /data
- name the container `my_container`
- download the immuneML Docker image from DockerHub from user milenapavlovic
- in a thus created environment, it will run immune-ml-quickstart as described above and store the output to /data/output/ directory
which will be visible later in the current working directory under `output/`.

.. code-block:: console

  docker run -it -v $(pwd):/data --name my_container milenapavlovic/immuneml immune-ml-quickstart /data/output/

The image reference (here `milenapavlovic/immuneml`) can be replaced with any relevant image, and the
command following the image should then be adapted to the particular use-case for the downloaded image.

  `the reference <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/>`_.

Create a Docker image and publish it on DockerHub
````````````````````````````````````````````````````

.. note:: ðŸŒ³

  Aim: provide references for creating a Docker image and publishing it in a public repository DockerHub

  Level: journeyman ðŸŒ³

To create a Docker image, follow the `Getting started <https://docs.docker.com/get-started/>`_ guide. Parts 1-4
describe how to come up with an image and publish it on DockerHub, that can then be used as described above.

If you are using GitHub for code development and want to use that code as a basis for a Docker image,
this process can also be automated to create a new image on a certain event and publish it on DockerHub.

For example, see the `action YAML file on immuneML repository <https://github.com/uio-bmi/immuneML/blob/master/.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml>`_.
Every time push is performed to the master branch, the image will be rebuilt based on
`the Dockerfile <https://github.com/uio-bmi/immuneML/blob/master/Dockerfile>`_ at the
repository and published.

  Aim: give an overview of different services that can be used to share tools during the development or after they are developed

  Level: apprentice ðŸŒ¿

This document gives an overview of different services that can be used to share developed tools in the bioinformatics field, or when developing tools in general.

The services discussed here are Galaxy, Docker, Binder, Google Colab, and pip/conda.


Galaxy
======
`Galaxy <https://galaxyproject.org/>`_ is a web-based platform for data-intensive biomedical research that allows the user to perform analyses through a user interface set up by the developers. This way, the user can upload and analyze data without working with code or installing anything locally on their machine.

Behind the scenes, Galaxy will handle the server setup and the storage of the data, so the user can focus on the analysis itself.

Setting up Galaxy
-----------------

Developer's side
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Setting up a Galaxy instance starts with cloning the Galaxy repository on `GitHub <https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy>`_. This provides the developer with a base Galaxy instance that the developer can customize to fit the workflow of the developed tool. The developer can add and remove tools, add a customized homepage, grant themselves admin access to the instance, etc.

After the instance is set up, the developer can host it on a server or a cloud service of choice, where the user can access it from their internet browser via a URL link.

Docker
======
`Docker <https://www.docker.com>`_ is a platform that allows developers to develop, share, and run applications regardless of the system details of the used machine. Usually, when a developed tool is shared with others, it might happen that it would work on one machine but not on the other. This is usually due to the fact that each machine might have its own operating system, dependencies and configuration files, system tools, settings, etc. Docker aims to solve this problem by providing a way to package all the dependencies and system files in one piece of software, called a Docker image, which can be shared and run on any system, regardless of its technical details.

When such an image is hosted on a server or run locally on a machine, it becomes a Docker container, i.e. a piece of software that "contains" everything your tool needs to bu run properly. Once that is done, the user can access and use the tool from the command line or their preferred tool, e.g. jupyter notebook.

Setting up Docker
-----------------

Developer's side
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To set up a docker image, first, you install Docker on your machine and then write what is known as a docker file. This file includes a set of instructions that groups and installs all the files and requirements that are needed to run the tool. The next step is to build a docker image from that file using the :code:`docker build` command. During that process, the Docker engine will go through these instructions one by one and execute the corresponding commands.

Once the image is built, you can share it with others or post it on `DockerHub <https://hub.docker.com/>`_, an online library of Docker images.

User's side
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
From the user's side, all you need to do is to install Docker on your machine, then run the docker image from the command line using the :code:`docker run` command. Depending on you how the developer has set up the docker file, running this command will connect you to a virtual OS where everything is set up for the tool to run properly.

In addition, you can choose to host that image on a server of choice instead of running it on your local machine, in case you need access to more computational resources, for instance.

Binder
======
If you donâ€™t want to go through all of these steps or you don't really need control at a system level, and the tool is developed in Python, then one option would be to use
`Binder <https://mybinder.org/>`_. The idea of Binder is that if you have Jupyter notebooks on a open-access repository or a version control service, e.g. Zenodo, or GitHub,
and you want to run them with as few steps as possible, then you can turn that repo into an executable environment set up with everything the tool needs.

Actually, what happens behind the scenes is that BinderHub, the backend of Binder, will create a Docker image from the repo, launch it in the Cloud,
and connect you to it via your browser.

Binder supports three languages Julia, Python, and R, though, a Binder session ends after a short period of inactivity (10 min) and
provides up to 6 hours of run time, so it is intended for short and quick use instead of running computations that take a lot of time.
You also get 2G of RAM.

Additionally, the repo which you want to turn into such an executable environment should be public, as the Binder development team
chose not to handle the security issues related to handling private repositories. Still, if accessing private repositories is a
feature you need, Binder gives you the option of building your own BinderHub. In fact, the public service that you would usually
use, `mybinder.org <https://mybinder.org>`_,  is actually where one such deployment lives.


Setting up Binder
-----------------

Developer's side
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Setting up a Binder instance is a simple procedure that requires only a public repository, e.g. GitHyb repo, ideally with pre-written
Jypyter notebooks. To set this up, you go to `mybinder.org <https://mybinder.org>`_, fill in the details of the repository, and
optionally include a default Jupyter notebook that you want to be set up once the instance is launched.

Once you add all the information, you can either share the link that Binder provides, or optionally copy a text provided by Binder
and paste it into the README file of the repository. This shows a binder badge on the repo's homepage from which the users can
launch a Binder instance.

User's side
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
From the user's side, launching a binder instance is as easy as opening the link provided by the developers, or clicking on the badge
on the homepage of the repository.


Google Colab
============
Another service that offers a similar solution is `Google Colab <https://research.google.com/colaboratory/>`_. Colab is a service
that allows you to run Jypyter notebooks on Google servers with access to more computational power (including GPUs and TPUs),
more RAM, and more storage if needed. The sessions also allow for up to 90 minutes of inactivity and it can run for up to 12 hours.
One extra feature provided by Colab is the ability to connect it to Google Drive, giving the developer read and write access to the
Google Drive.

If you need more resources, you can upgrade to Pro and Pro+ and get more RAM, better GPUs, and up to 24 hours of runtime. However,
these upgrades are currently not available in many countries including Norway.


Setting up Colab
-----------------
Setting a Colab notebook can be performed by either of both, the developer of the tool and a user of it. This is done by simply
cloning the GitHub repository using the :code:`clone` command within a Colab notebook, followed by using the Python code written by
the developer.

Pip
=====
`pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable>`_ is the package installer for Python, which you use to install Python packages that are,
usually, hosted on the Python Package Index (PyPI). Ideally, this is the method that would be used when a Python tool is fully
developed.

Setting up pip
-----------------

Developer's side
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Once the tool is developed and ready to be published, building it as a (Python) package includes a couple of steps to ensure that
it can be installed using pip, while also installing the dependencies and the libraries that the tool needs. The general layout for
this starts with creating an account and registering yourself on PyPI, installing some tools required to build packages, creating
a :code:`setup.py` file along with a LICENCE, and finally compiling the package using the already mentioned tools. Once the package
is built, you can share it and make it publicly available by uploading it to PyPI where other users can download it and install it.

Centre for Bioinformatics - Knowledge Base
===========================================

For a bioinformatician, a broad variety of topics may be of interest to design and conduct an analysis.
This repository is a collection of resources for these tasks grouped by a common theme. The resources include both custom content
and links to relevant online material and training.

The resources here cover:

1. :ref:`Designing an analysis`: domain-specific information related to statistics, machine learning,
   adaptive immune receptor repertoires and other fields,

2. :ref:`Programming` starting from choosing a language to best practices like modular design, object oriented programming, testing,

3. :ref:`Setting up and organizing a project` including project management tools, version control, editors, and

4. :ref:`Running an analysis` describing running the command line and other recommended tools, and commonly used infrastructure.

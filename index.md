===========================================

For a bioinformatician, a broad variety of topics may be of interest to design and conduct an analysis. 
This repository is a collection of resources for these tasks grouped by a common theme. The resources include both custom content
and links to relevant online material and training.

The resources here cover:

1. [designing an analysis](analysis_design.md): domain-specific information related to statistics, machine learning, 
adaptive immune receptor repertoires and other fields,

2. [programming topics](programming.md) starting from choosing a language to best practices like modular design, object oriented programming, 
testing,

3. [setting up and organizing the project](setting_up_project.md) including project management tools, version control, editors, and

4. [running an analysis](running_analysis.md) describing running the command line and other recommended tools, and commonly used infrastructure.
